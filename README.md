# Pseudocoder: now with less effort!
Ever wanted to convert pseudocode to a certain language? Well here it is!

## Requirements
You need a [key for google gemini](https://ai.google.dev/), and that's essentially it.

## Usage
```
python pseudocoder.py file.txt language
```
Note that language isn't case-sensitive, so go nuts I guess?
